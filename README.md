# üì£ What's new?

  <summary><strong> Save your conversations and continue at any time</strong></summary>

1. Conversation history

- The goal: Collect feedback and measure the compatibility across different machine, OS setups.
- We are experimenting a new feature to help you store your conversations in your disk using VS Code global storage API.
- You need to opt-in to use this feature as this is experimental to collect feedback from the users. Setting name: `genieai.enableConversationHistory`
- With this experimental feature, keep in mind this feature has limitations at the moment and may have bugs, use it at your own risk.
- You may want to remove the stored files manually for privacy from time to time, extension doesn't have any way to modify the files other than writing new threads to files.
- All conversations start with name 'New chat' and you can change it in `genie.json` file.
- The conversations are stored only on your machine, using VS Code's provided global storage API for extensions.

2. Misc. bug fixes and improvements

# Get Started

Get your API Key from here: [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

1. Simply ask any coding question by selecting a code fragment.
2. Once asked, provide your API Key.

See below for the models that are available via API:

| Available model    | Description                                                                                                                               | Max token | Knowledge |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| gpt-4              | More capable than any GPT-3.5 model, able to do more complex tasks, and optimized for chat.                                               | 8,192     | Sep 2021  |
| gpt-4-32k          | Same capabilities as the base gpt-4 mode but with 4x the context length.                                                                  | 32,768     | Sep 2021  |
| gpt-3.5-turbo      | Most capable GPT-3.5 model and optimized for chat at 1/10th the cost of `text-davinci-003`.                                               | 4,096     | Sep 2021  |
| gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 | Snapshot of `gpt-3.5-turbo` from March 1st 2023.                                                                                          | 4,096     | Sep 2021  |
| text-davinci-003   | Can do any language task with better quality, longer output, and consistent instruction-following than the curie, babbage, or ada models. | 4,000     | Jun 2021  |
| text-davinci-002   | Similar capabilities to `text-davinci-003` but trained with supervised fine-tuning instead of reinforcement learning                      | 4,000     | Jun 2021  |
| code-davinci-002   | Optimized for code-completion tasks                                                                                                       | 4,000     | Jun 2021  |
| code-cushman-001   | Almost as capable as Davinci Codex, but slightly faster. This speed advantage may make it preferable for real-time applications.          | 2,048     |           |

# Troubleshooting

## FAQ

- Re-enter API key: use `Genie: Clear API Key` command. Click `Commands` on the home page to see all commands available
- Proxy support: See this issue to enable local proxy: #7
- Usage in Remote environments: See this issue about remote/SSH: #3
- Unable To Use GPT-4 Models: You need GPT-4 API Access (Different than GPT-4 on ChatGPT Plus subscription) #6

## Common Issues

- It's possible that OpenAI systems may experience issues responding to your queries due to high-traffic from time to time.
- If you get `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`, it means that you are making Too Many Requests. Please wait and try again in a few moments. If it persists, restart your vs-code.

  - This could be due to `insufficient_quota` on your OpenAI account. You could run the following cURL command to check if your account has enough quota. (Make sure to replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key that you use in this extension)

  ```bash
    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
      "model": "text-davinci-003",
      "prompt": "Can I make a request?\n\n",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 256,
      "top_p": 1,
      "frequency_penalty": 0,
      "presence_penalty": 0
    }'
  ```

- If you get `HTTP 404 Not Found` error, it means one of the parameters you provided is unknown (i.e. `genieai.openai.model`). Most likely switching to default `model` in your settings would fix this issue.
- If you get `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error, it means that your conversation's length is more than GPT/Codex models can handle. Or you supplied an invalid argument via customized settings.
- If you encounter persistent issues with your queries
  - Try `Genie: Reset session` to clear your session/conversation or `Genie: Clear API Key` to clear your API Key and re-enter
  - As a last resort try restarting your VS-Code and retry logging in.
- If you are using Remote Development and cannot use ChatGPT
  - In `settings.json` add `"remote.extensionKind": {"genieai.chatgpt-vscode": ["ui"]}`
